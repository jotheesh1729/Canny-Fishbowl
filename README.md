##Context: 
IoT, where real-world things are built into intelligent things
that are controlled virtually. In order to provide us control over the
things around us and to keep us updated on their status, the IoT
aspires to bring everything in our environment under one common in-
frastructure. These days IoT can be seen in very common, day-to-day
things. One such thing is an aquarium. With the help of IoT, aquar-
iums have developed a lot. One of their few functionalities is being
monitored by the user remotely.

##Objectives: 
The main objective of the project is to build an IoT
based smart aquarium along with a web application and a mobile
application where the aquarium can be monitored remotely. The web
application and the mobile application will show the readings precisely
of the monitored aquarium and will have options like feed, pump, etc.
The readings are taken from the sensors and the options provided are
actuators.

##Methods: 
We developed a model in which sensor readings are trans-
mitted from an Arduino to an MQTT broker, and then used those
readings to create an interactive web and mobile application.
Results:. Our projectâ€™s prototype is successfully acquiring data from
the sensors and sending it to an MQTT broker. The data is then dis-
played on a custom web and mobile app that we developed, allowing
users to view the data in real time and interact with the actuators.

##Conclusions: 
ThedevelopmentofourIoT-basedsmartaquariumhas
demonstrated the potential for the Internet of Things to improve the
lives of aquarium owners and the health of their aquatic pets. The sys-
tem allows for remote monitoring and control of various parameters,
such as temperature and water level, using MQTT protocols for effi-
cient and reliable communication. We believe that this system has the
potential to change the way aquariums are managed and maintained,
and we hope that our work will inspire others to utilize the power of
the IoT in innovative ways to solve real-world problems. There is also
room for further advancement in this field, and we are excited to see
what the future holds for the development of smart aquariums and
other IoT-based solutions.
